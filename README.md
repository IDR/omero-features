OMERO.features
==============

Documentation and code for investigating potential feature storage solutions for OMERO.

Version 1
---------

This is the first version of an API for storing and retrieving features in OMERO.
See examples.py for an example of how to use this.

The aim was to create a basic functional client-side library usable by external developers without requiring any changes to OMERO.

Feedback from this initial implementation being used to inform changes to the core OMERO components needed to support big and potentially unstructured data sets.
